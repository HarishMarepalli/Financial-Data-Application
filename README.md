Financial-Data-Application
--------------------------
This is a small financial data application using Python and related APIs. In this, I:
1. Researched to find a set of python APIs that I can use to retrieve financial data and used IEX Cloud API.
2. Implemented a Python program where it will take a stock symbol as input and output the following: Current date and time Full name of the company Stock price Value changes (+ for increase and - for decrease) Percentage changes (+ for increase and - for decrease)
3. The program also handles any error situation (such as no network, invalid symbol, etc.)
